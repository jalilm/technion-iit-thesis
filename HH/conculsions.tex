\label{sec:conclusions}

In this chapter, we presented a new algorithm for  detecting Heavy Hitter flows.  Our algorithm   performs better than the state of art algorithm for practical sizes of available on device memory. The estimated frequency reported by the algorithm is in the range of $1\pm \delta$ from their actual frequency. Furthermore, we evaluated our algorithm on real internet traces and showed that it performs better, in terms of Detection Rate, False Positive Ratio and Throughput, than best existing  algorithms in various settings. More specifically, when processing $10^7$ packets our algorithm performs better for any amount of memory less than $1MB$. This also holds for $10^6, 10^5$ packets with memories of $0.5MB, 0.25MB$ respectively.
