In an SDN network, these primitives may require sig- nificant bandwidth, memory and processing resources, and the re- sources dedicated to these can affect the accuracy of the even- tual measurement. In this paper, we first qualitatively discuss the tradeoff space of resource usage versus accuracy for these different primitives as a function of the spatial and temporal measurement granularity, then quantify these tradeoffs in the context of hierar- chical heavy hitter detection.},

abstract = {Most database management systems maintain statistics on the underlying relation. One of the important statistics is that of the “hot items” in the relation: those that appear many times (most frequently, or more than some threshold). For example, end-biased histograms keep the hot items as part of the histogram and are used in selectivity estimation. Hot items are used as simple outliers in data mining, and in anomaly detection in many applications.We present new methods for dynamically determining the hot items at any time in a relation which is undergoing deletion operations as well as inserts. Our methods maintain small space data structures that monitor the transactions on the relation, and, when required, quickly output all hot items without rescanning the relation in the database. With user-specified probability, all hot items are correctly reported. Our methods rely on ideas from “group testing.” They are simple to implement, and have provable quality, space, and time guarantees. Previously known algorithms for this problem that make similar quality and performance guarantees cannot handle deletions, and those that handle deletions cannot make similar guarantees without rescanning the database. Our experiments with real and synthetic data show that our algorithms are accurate in dynamically tracking the hot items independent of the rate of insertions and deletions.},

abstract = {Today's data centers offer tremendous aggregate bandwidth to clusters of tens of thousands of machines. However, because of limited port densities in even the highest-end switches, data center topologies typically consist of multi-rooted trees with many equal-cost paths between any given pair of hosts. Existing IP multipathing protocols usually rely on per-flow static hashing and can cause substantial bandwidth losses due to longterm collisions. In this paper, we present Hedera, a scalable, dynamic flow scheduling system that adaptively schedules a multi-stage switching fabric to efficiently utilize aggregate network resources. We describe our implementation using commodity switches and unmodified hosts, and show that for a simulated 8,192 host data center, Hedera delivers bisection bandwidth that is 96{\%} of optimal and up to 113{\%} better than static load-balancing methods.},

The traces display a highly nonuniform distribution of traffic on flows between pairs of hosts, networks, and ASes. Aggregation along coarser granularities, such as networks or ASes, accentuates this nonuniform distribution. In one typical trace, for example, the top 9{\%} of flows between ASes accounts for 86.7{\%} of the packets and 90.7{\%} of the bytes transmitted. A highly nonuniform traffic pattern suggests that routers need to maintain only limited QoS flow state. The paper discusses the implications of this phenomenon on different proposed QoS mechanisms},

Providing an aggregate view of such data is important for summarization, visualization, and analysis. We develop an aggregate view based on certain organized sets of large-valued regions (“heavy hitters”) corresponding to hierarchically discounted frequency counts. We formally define the notion of hierarchical heavy hitters (HHHs). We first consider computing (approximate) HHHs over a data stream drawn from a single hierarchical attribute.

abstract = {The querying and analysis of data streams has been a topic of much recent interest, motivated by applications from the fields of networking, web usage analysis, sensor instrumentation, telecommuni- cations, and others. Many of these applications involve monitoring answers to continuous queries over data streams produced at physically distributed locations, and most previous approaches require streams to be transmitted to a single location for centralized processing. Unfortunately, the continual transmis- sion of a large number of rapid data streams to a central location can be impractical or expensive. We study a useful class of queries that continuously report the k largest values obtained from distributed data streams (“top-k monitoring queries”), which are of particular interest because they can be used to reduce the overhead incurred while running other types of monitoring queries. We show that transmit- ting entire data streams is unnecessary to support these queries and present an alternative approach that reduces communication significantly. In our approach, arithmetic constraints are maintained at remote stream sources to ensure that the most recently provided top-k answer remains valid to within a user- specified error tolerance. Distributed communication is only necessary on occasion, when constraints are violated, and we show empirically through extensive simulation on real-world data that our approach reduces overall communication cost by an order of magnitude compared with alternatives that offer the same error guarantees.},

abstract = {We consider a router on the Internet analyzing the statistical properties of a TCP/IP packet stream. A fundamental difficulty with measuring traffic behavior on the Internet is that there is simply too much data to be recorded for later analysis, on the order of gigabytes a second. As a result, network routers can collect only relatively few statistics about the data. The central problem addressed here is to use the limited memory of routers to determine essential features of the network traffic stream. A particularly difficult and representative subproblem is to determine the top k categories to which the most packets belong, for a desired value of k and for a given notion of categorization such as the destination IP address. We present an algorithm that deterministically finds (in particular) all categories having a frequency above 1/(m + 1) using m counters, which we prove is best possible in the worst case. We also present a sampling-based algorithm for the case that packet categories follow an arbitrary distribution, but their order over time is permuted uniformly at random. Under this model, our algorithm identifies flows above a frequency threshold of roughly 1 nm with high probability, where m is the number of counters and n is the number of packets observed. This guarantee is not far off from the ideal of identifying all flows (probability 1/n), and we prove that it is best possible up to a logarithmic factor. We show that the algorithm ranks the identified flows according to frequency within any desired constant factor of accuracy},

abstract = {Identifying heavy hitter flows is a fundamental problem in various network domains. The well established method of using sketches to approximate flow statistics suffers from space inefficiencies. In addition, flow arrival rates are dynamic, thus keeping track of the most recent heavy hitters poses a challenge. Sliding window approximations address this problem, reducing space at the cost of increasing point query time. This paper presents two novel algorithms for identifying heavy hitters in streams and sliding windows. Both algorithms use statically allocated memory and support constant time point queries. For sliding windows, this is an asymptotic improvement over previous work. We also demonstrate reduced memory requirements of up to 85{\%} in streams and 66{\%} in sliding windows over synthetic and real Internet packet traces.},

We recommend that you read Chapters 1 to 5, in that order. In Chapter 1, a simple switch hub is implemented, and in later chapters, traffic monitor and link aggregation functions are added. Through actual examples, we describe programming using Ryu. Chapters 6 to 8 provide details about the OpenFlow protocol and the packet libraries that are necessary for pro- gramming using Ryu. In Chapters 9 to 11, we talk about how to use the firewall and test tool included in the Ryu package as sample applications. Chapters 12 to 14 introduce Ryu's architecture and introduction cases. Finally, we would like to say thank you to those people, in particular users, who supported the Ryu project. We are waiting for your opinions via the mailing list. Let's develop Ryu together!},

abstract = {Fine-grained traffic flow measurement, which provides useful information for network management tasks and security analysis, can be challenging to obtain due to monitoring resource constraints. The alternate approach of inferring flow statistics from partial measurement data has to be robust against dynamic temporal/spatial fluctuations of network traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Traffic (de)Aggregation and Measurement Paradigm (iSTAMP), which partitions TCAM entries of switches/routers into two parts to: 1) optimally aggregate part of incoming flows for aggregate measurements, and 2) de-aggregate and directly measure the most informative flows for per-flow measurements. iSTAMP then processes these aggregate and per-flow measurements to effectively estimate network flows using a variety of optimization techniques. With the advent of Software-Defined-Networking (SDN), such real-time rule (re)configuration can be achieved via OpenFlow or other similar SDN APIs. We first show how to design the optimal aggregation matrix for minimizing the flow-size estimation error. Moreover, we propose a method for designing an efficient-compressive flow aggregation matrix under hard resource constraints of limited TCAM sizes. In addition, we propose an intelligent Multi-Armed Bandit based algorithm to adaptively sample the most {\&}{\#}x201C;rewarding{\&}{\#}x201D; flows, whose accurate measurements have the highest impact on the overall flow measurement and estimation performance. We evaluate the performance of iSTAMP using real traffic traces from a variety of network environments and by considering two applications: traffic matrix estimation and heavy hitter detection. Also, we have implemented a prototype of iSTAMP and demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in Mininet environment.},

This problem has applications to network traffic monitoring, anomaly detection, and DDoS detection. We present a new streaming approximation algorithm for computing Hierarchical Heavy Hitters that has several advantages over previous algorithms. It improves on the worst-case time and space bounds of earlier algorithms, is conceptually simple and substantially easier to implement, offers improved accuracy guarantees, is easily adopted to a distributed or parallel setting, and can be efficiently implemented in commodity hardware such as ternary content addressable memory (TCAMs). We present experimental results showing that for parameters of primary practical interest, our two-dimensional algorithm is superior to existing algorithms in terms of speed and accuracy, and competitive in terms of space, while our one-dimensional algorithm is also superior in terms of speed and accuracy for a more limited range of parameters.},

abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm where network functions are executed on commodity servers located in small cloud nodes distributed across the network, and where software defined mechanisms are used to control the network flows. This paradigm is a major turning point in the evolution of networking, as it introduces high expectations for enhanced economical network services, as well as major technical challenges. In this paper, we address one of the main technical challenges in this domain: the actual placement of the virtual functions within the physical network. This placement has a critical impact on the performance of the network, as well as on its reliability and operation cost. We perform a thorough study of the NFV location problem, show that it introduces a new type of optimization problems, and provide near optimal approximation algorithms guaranteeing a placement with theoretically proven performance. The performance of the solution is evaluated with respect to two measures: the distance cost between the clients and the virtual functions by which they are served, as well as the setup costs of these functions. We provide bi-criteria solutions reaching constant approximation factors with respect to the overall performance, and adhering to the capacity constraints of the networking infrastructure by a constant factor as well. Finally, using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms perform well in many realistic scenarios.},

abstract = {Traffic matrix measurement provides essential information for network design, operation and management. In today's networks, it is challenging to get accurate and timely traffic matrix due to the hard resource constraints of network devices. Recently, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique enables customizable traffic measurement, which can provide flexible and fine-grain visibility into network traffic. However, the existing software-defined traffic measurement solutions often suffer from feasibility and scalability issues. In this paper, we seek accurate, feasible and scalable traffic matrix estimation approaches. We propose two strategies, called Maximum Load Rule First (MLRF) and Large Flow First (LFF), to design feasible traffic measurement rules that can be installed in TCAM entries of SDN switches. The statistics of the measurement rules are collected by the controller to estimate fine-grained traffic matrix. Both MLRF and LFF satisfy the flow aggregation constraints (determined by associated routing policies) and have low-complexity. Extensive simulation results on real network and traffic traces reveal that MLRF and LFF can achieve high accuracy of traffic matrix estimation and high probability of heavy hitter detection.},

This paper originally presents an expense-minimizing framework for top-k monitoring in sensor cloud services where the expense is denoted by the costs of data requests. Instead of fetching all the latest data in each timestamp, we propose a novel "-top-k query delivering approximate top-k answers with a probabilistic guarantee on the selectively-fetched dataset which is a combination of certain and uncertain data (modelled by their age). In addition, using a cloud environment as well as our proposed method to process "-top-k queries can alleviate the computing-intensive computations, so it is not only cheaper but even faster than an ordinary top-k calculation method. The extensive experiments on the real-world climate datasets demonstrate that our methods can reduce the expense by more than half with desirable accuracy. {\&}copy; 2016 ACM.},

For general data distributions, our top-k algorithm can return a set of k′ elements, where k′ ≈ k, which are guaranteed to be the top-k' elements; and we use minimal space for calculating frequent elements. For realistic Zipfian data, our space requirement for the frequent elements problem decreases dramatically with the parameter of the distribution; and for top-k queries, we ensure that only the top-k elements, in the correct order, are reported.

abstract = {Top-k monitoring is important to many wireless sensor applications. This paper exploits the semantics of top-k query and proposes an energy-efficient monitoring approach called FILA. The basic idea is to install a filter at each sensor node to suppress unnecessary sensor updates. Filter setting and query reevaiuation upon updates are two fundamental issues to the correctness and efficiency of the FILA approach. We develop a query reevaiuation algorithm that is capable of handling concurrent sensor updates. In particular, we present optimization techniques to reduce the probing cost. We design a skewed filter setting scheme, which aims to balance energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. Moreover, two filter update strategies, namely, eager and lazy, are proposed to favor different application scenarios. We also extend the algorithms to several variants of top-k query, that is, orderinsensitive, approximate, and value monitoring. The performance of the proposed FILA approach is extensively evaluated using real data traces. The results show that FILA substantially outperforms the existing TAG-based approach and range caching approach in terms of both network lifetime and energy consumption under various network configurations. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The recent growing popularity of cloud-based solutions and the variety of new applications present new challenges for cloud management and resource utilization. In this paper we concentrate on the networking aspect and consider the placement problem of virtual machines (VMs) of applications with intense bandwidth requirements. Optimizing the available network bandwidth is far more complex than optimizing resources like memory or CPU, since every network link may be used by many physical hosts and thus by the VMs residing in these hosts. We focus on maximizing the benefit from the overall communication sent by the VMs to a single designated point in the data center (called the root). This is the typical case when considering a storage area network of applications with intense storage requirements. We formulate a bandwidth-constrained VM placement optimization problem that models this setting. This problem is NP hard, and we present a polynomial-time constant approximation algorithm for its most general version, in which hosts are connected to the root by a general network graph. For more practical cases, in which the network topology is a tree and the revenue is a simple function of the allocated bandwidth, we present improved approximation algorithms that are more efficient in terms of running time. We evaluate the expected performance of our proposed algorithms through a simulation study over traces from a real production data center, providing strong indications to the superiority of our proposed solutions.},

abstract = {OpenFlow is a protocol implementing Software Defined Networking, a new networking paradigm, which segregates packet forwarding and accounting (performed on switches) from the routing decisions and advanced protocols (executed on a central controller). This segregation increases agility and flexibility of a networking infrastructure and reduces its operational expenses. OpenFlow controllers expose standard interfaces to facilitate variety of networking applications. In particular, a monitoring application can use these interfaces to push into the OpenFlow switches rules that collect traffic flow statistics at different aggregation levels. The aggregation level determines the monitoring accuracy and the induced network overhead. In this paper, we propose Floware an OpenFlow application that allows discovery and monitoring of active flows at any required aggregation level. Floware balances the monitoring overhead among many switches in order to reduce its negative effect on network performance. In addition, Floware integrates with monitoring systems based on legacy protocols such as NetFlow. We demonstrate the application with soft switches emulated in Mininet, the Floodlight controller, and the NetFlow Analyzer as a legacy network analysis and intrusion detection system.

abstract = {Network management requires accurate estimates of met-rics for many applications including traffic engineering (e.g., heavy hitters), anomaly detection (e.g., entropy of source addresses), and security (e.g., DDoS detection). Obtain-ing accurate estimates given router CPU and memory con-straints is a challenging problem. Existing approaches fall in one of two undesirable extremes: (1) low fidelity general-purpose approaches such as sampling, or (2) high fidelity but complex algorithms customized to specific application-level metrics. Ideally, a solution should be both general (i.e., supports many applications) and provide accuracy com-parable to custom algorithms. This paper presents Univ-Mon, a framework for flow monitoring which leverages re-cent theoretical advances and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both generality and high accuracy. UnivMon uses an application-agnostic data plane monitoring primitive; dif-ferent (and possibly unforeseen) estimation algorithms run in the control plane, and use the statistics from the data plane to compute application-level metrics. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of UnivMon using P4 and de-velop simple coordination techniques to provide a " one-big-switch " abstraction for network-wide monitoring. We eval-uate the effectiveness of UnivMon using a range of trace-driven evaluations and show that it offers comparable (and sometimes better) accuracy relative to custom sketching so-lutions across a range of monitoring tasks.},

abstract = {We focus on designing efficient flow monitoring algorithms in SDN/OpenFlow by fully exploiting all three polling mechanisms, poll-single, poll-some and poll-all. Notably, the poll-some mechanism has not been adopted by any existing flow monitoring algorithm due to the inflexible match structure standardized in the early version of the OpenFlow specification. To enable the poll-some mechanism, we need to find out the minimum number of match structures required to exactly match all not-yet-covered flows at a switch. An efficient heuristic called Critical Column First (CCF) is then proposed for solving the Minimum Match Structure (MMS) problem. The idea is to consider the column of the flow matrix that can potentially identify the largest number of not-yet-covered flows first. With CCF, an existing flow monitoring algorithm called LFF [1] is extended to support all three polling mechanisms. We call it LFF+ algorithm. As compared with LFF, simulation results show that LFF+ can cut down the communication cost by about 54{\%}.},

Meanwhile, OpenFlow-enabled switches provide rich statistical information for specific flows, tables, and ports which facilitates various network management tasks. However, current traffic monitoring techniques collecting statistics from existing flow entries do not provide the flexibility of querying path-specific flow statistics at any aggregation levels. In this paper, we proposes PathMon which encodes flow and path information as tags to provide that flexibility and corresponding link-to-link correlations for further anomaly detection or traffic engineering tasks.

One of the main management challenges in IXP networks is the management of the so-called elephant flows. Elephant flows, characterized by high throughput and long duration, represent a small fraction of the total flows of an IXP network but have high impact on the overall traffic. A first step in the management of elephant flows is their identification, which becomes more important in SDN-based IXPs that require controllers to have a consistent view of the underlying network to allow fine-grained adjustment. In this paper, we propose, develop, and evaluate a monitoring system to identify elephant flows in an SDN-based IXP network. We demonstrate that our system can assist IXP operators to properly identify elephant flows in an efficient, scalable, and timely manner.},

abstract = {—We report on design, implementation and evaluation of a resource management system that builds upon OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform for private and public clouds that is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry. Our implementation supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud and cur-rently provides allocation for computational resources in support of interactive as well as computationally intensive applications. The design supports an extensible set of management objectives between which the system can switch at runtime. We demonstrate through examples how management objectives related to load-balancing, energy efficiency and service differentiation can be mapped onto the controllers of the resource allocation subsystem, which attempts to achieve an activated management objective at all times. The design is extensible in the sense that addi-tional objectives can be introduced by providing instantiations for generic functions in the controllers. Our implementation monitors the fulfillment of the relevant management metrics in real time. Testbed evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in a dynamic environment. It further illustrates the trade-off between closely meeting a specific management objective and the associated cost of VM live-migration. Index Terms—Cloud management, performance management, management objective, dynamic resource management, Open-Stack I. INTRODUCTION The paper reports on design, implementation and evalua-tion of a resource management system that builds upon the OpenStack cloud platform. The focus is on managing an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, which makes ICT infrastructure available to customers in a virtualized way, including computation in form of virtual machines (VMs), storage in form of virtual disks, for instance, and networking in form of virtual switches, for example. IaaS cloud services are offered by an increasing number of providers, whereby Amazon and RackSpace are probably the most well-known. IaaS cloud environments have proved suitable for running interactive applications, such as websites and social networks, analytics frameworks like MapReduce or media streaming services, such as audio or video on-demand services. The IaaS service model has two principal stakeholders: the IaaS provider who owns and operates the cloud infrastructure and the customers who run their applications on the cloud. (If an IaaS customer, runs a web site, for instance, it has its own customer base that consumes cloud resources through the site.) Customers typically have service level agreements},

abstract = {Monitoring global states of a distributed cloud application is a critical functionality for cloud datacenter management. State monitoring requires meeting two demanding objectives: high level of correctness, which ensures zero or low error rate, and high communication efficiency, which demands minimal communication cost in detecting state updates. Most existing work follows an instantaneous model which triggers state alerts whenever a constraint is violated. This model may cause frequent and unnecessary alerts due to momentary value bursts and outliers. Countermeasures of such alerts may further cause problematic operations. In this paper, we present a WIndow-based StatE monitoring (WISE) framework for efficiently managing cloud applications. Window-based state monitoring reports alerts only when state violation is continuous within a time window. We show that it is not only more resilient to value bursts and outliers, but also able to save considerable communication when implemented in a distributed manner based on four technical contributions. First, we present the architectural design and deployment options for window-based state monitoring with centralized parameter tuning. Second, we develop a new distributed parameter tuning scheme enabling WISE to scale to much more monitoring nodes as each node tunes its monitoring parameters reactively without global information. Third, we introduce two optimization techniques, including their design rationale, correctness and usage model, to further reduce the communication cost. Finally, we provide an in-depth empirical study of the scalability of WISE, and evaluate the improvement brought by the distributed tuning scheme and the two performance optimizations. Our results show that WISE reduces communication by 50-90 percent compared with instantaneous monitoring approaches, and the improved WISE gains a clear scalability advantage over its centralized version.},

abstract = {In many cases, data networks need to be monitored to ensure that they stay within acceptable parameters. The monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. In many cases it is too complex, or too expensive, to conduct explicit monitoring at all times. In these cases, information (integrity constraints) on the evolution of the network status can often allow us to use past measurements to infer the future behavior, thus reducing the monitoring cost. We provide a formal description of the problem of monitoring rapidly changing data, which we call the monitoring problem. We then classify this problem in terms of the integrity constraints that govern the evolution of the environment, and propose different algorithms for each of these classes. For the most restricted case, we can find a greedy algorithm which is optimal, while for the more general cases, we use competitive analysis and show that optimal worst and average case cost measuring algorithms exist. We then present heuristics for low-cost low-complexity measuring algorithms. We believe that the results of this paper can serve as a framework for further studies.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maintaining aggregates and statistics over data streams, with respect to the last N data elements seen so far. We refer to this model as the sliding window model. We consider the following basic problem: Given a stream of bits, maintain a count of the number of 1's in the last N elements seen from the stream. We show that, using O(1 log 2 N) bits of memory, we can estimate the number of 1's to within a factor of 1 + . We also give a matching lower bound of Ω(1 log 2 N) memory bits for any deterministic or randomized algorithms. We extend our scheme to maintain the sum of the last N positive integers and provide matching upper and lower bounds for this more general problem as well. We also show how to efficiently compute the Lp norms (p ∈ [1, 2]) of vectors in the sliding window model using our techniques. Using our algorithm, one can adapt many other techniques to work for the sliding window model with a multiplicative overhead of O(1 log N) in memory and a 1 + factor loss in accuracy. These include maintaining approximate histograms, hash tables, and statistics or aggregates such as sum and averages. 1. Introduction. Traditional database management systems (DBMSs) expect all data to be managed within some form of persistent data sets. For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite, is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is appropriate when significant portions of the data are queried again and again, and updates are small and/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream is appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to operate on large portions of the data multiple times. One of the challenging aspects of processing over data streams is that, while the length of a data stream may be unbounded, making it impractical or undesirable to store the entire contents of the stream, for many applications, it is still important to retain some ability to execute queries that reference past data. For example, in order to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, it is useful to be able to detect when the pattern of recent transactions for a particular account differs significantly from the earlier transactional history of that account. In order to support queries of this sort using a bounded amount of storage (either in memory or in a traditional DBMS), it is necessary to devise techniques for storing summary or synoptic information about previously seen portions of data streams. Generally there is a tradeoff between the},

abstract = {In software-defined networks (SDNs), the network controller first formulates abstract network-wide policies, and then implements them in the forwarding tables of network switches. However, fast SDN tables often cannot scale beyond a few hundred entries. This is because they typically include wildcards, and therefore are implemented using either expensive and power-hungry TCAMs, or complex and slow data structures. This paper presents the Palette distribution framework for decomposing large SDN tables into small ones and then distributing them across the network, while preserving the overall SDN policy semantics. Palette helps balance the sizes of the tables across the network, as well as reduce the total number of entries by sharing resources among different connections. It copes with two NP-hard optimization problems: Decomposing a large SDN table into equivalent subtables, and distributing the subtables such that each connection traverses each type of subtable at least once. To implement the Palette distribution framework, we introduce graph-theoretical formulations and algorithms, and show that they achieve close-to-optimal results in practice.},

abstract = {Software-defined networks can enable a variety of concurrent, dynamically instantiated, measurement tasks, that provide fine-grain visibility into network traffic. Recently, there have been many proposals to configure TCAM counters in hardware switches to monitor traffic. However, the TCAM memory at switches is fundamentally limited and the accuracy of the measurement tasks is a function of the resources devoted to them on each switch. This paper describes an adaptive measurement framework, called DREAM, that dynamically adjusts the resources devoted to each measurement task, while ensuring a user-specified level of accuracy. Since the trade-off between resource usage and accuracy can depend upon the type of tasks, their parameters, and traffic characteristics, DREAM does not assume an a priori characterization of this trade-off, but instead dynamically searches for a resource allocation that is sufficient to achieve a desired level of accuracy. A prototype implementation and simulations with three network-wide measurement tasks (heavy hitter, hierarchical heavy hitter and change detection) and diverse traffic show that DREAM can support more concurrent tasks with higher accuracy than several other alternatives.},

abstract = {Accurate online network monitoring is crucial for detecting attacks, faults, and anomalies, and determining traffic properties across the network. With high bandwidth links and consequently increasing traffic volumes, it is difficult to collect and analyze detailed flow records in an online manner. Traditional solutions that decouple data collection from analysis resort to sampling and sketching to handle large monitoring traffic volumes. We propose a new system, Pegasus, to leverage commercially available co-located compute and storage devices near routers and switches. Pegasus adaptively manages data transfers between monitors and aggregators based on traffic patterns and user queries. We use Pegasus to detect global icebergs or global heavy-hitters. Icebergs are flows with a common property that contribute a significant fraction of network traffic. For example, DDoS attack detection is an iceberg detection problem with a common destination IP. Other applications include identification of “top talkers,” top destinations, and detection of worms and port scans. Experiments with Abilene traces, sFlow traces from an enterprise network, and deployment of Pegasus as a live monitoring service on PlanetLab show that our system is accurate and scales well with increasing traffic and number of monitors.},

abstract = {Network monitoring is a major building block for many domains in communication networks. Besides typical accounting mechanisms and the emerging area of charging in next generation networks, especially network security solutions rely on efficient and optimized monitoring. Network monitoring in high-speed networks is usually based on flow accounting and aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-growing network capacities. In this paper, we propose a flexible flow aggregation mechanism that can be directly employed on a monitoring probe to reduce the memory and processing demands. Alternatively, it can work as a concentrator that collects flow data from multiple monitoring probes, combines and aggregates them and forwards the results to an analyzer. We verified and evaluated the aggregation mechanism by integrating it into our monitoring probe Vermont. Our approach opens new prospects for high-speed network monitoring and allows coping with special situations that cannot be treated satisfyingly by traditional flow accounting, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks causing very high numbers of flows. Aggregated flow data are an easy-to-handle form of packet information especially for anomaly detection and accounting issues},

While this design has allowed new applications and usage models to flourish, it also makes the job of network management significantly more challenging. This paper describes a new method of traffic characterization that automatically groups traffic into minimal clusters of conspicuous consumption. Rather than providing a static analysis specialized to capture flows, applications, or network-to-network traffic matrices, our approach dynamically produces hybrid traffic definitions that match the underlying usage. For example, rather than report five hundred small flows, or the amount of TCP traffic to port 80, or the "top ten hosts", our method might reveal that a certain percent of traffic was used by TCP connections between AOL clients and a particular group of Web servers. Similarly, our technique can be used to automatically classify new traffic patterns, such as network worms or peer-to-peer applications, without knowing the structure of such traffic a priori. We describe a series of algorithms for constructing these traffic clusters and minimizing their representation. In addition, we describe the design of our prototype system, AutoFocus and our experiences using it to discover the dominant and unusual modes of usage on several different production networks.},

abstract = {Networks are monitored in order to ensure that the system operates within desirable parameters. The increasing complexity of networks and services provided by them increases this need for monitoring. Monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. Conducting such monitoring introduces traffic overhead that may reduce the overall effective throughput. This paper studies ways to minimize the monitoring communication overhead in IP networks. We develop and analyze several monitoring algorithms that achieve significant reduction in the management overhead while maintaining the functionality. The main idea is to combine global polling with local event driven reporting. The amount of traffic saving depends on the statistical characterization of the monitored data. We indicate the specific statistical factors that affect the saving and show how to choose the right algorithm for the type, of monitored data. In particular, our results show that for Internet traffic our algorithms can save more than 90{\%} of the monitoring traffic.},

@article{Fagin2003a,
abstract = {Assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for each of m attributes. For example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. For each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its. grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). Each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, such as min or average. To determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. Fagin has given an algorithm ("Fagin's Algorithm", or FA) that is much more efficient. For some monotone aggregation functions, FA is optimal with high probability in the worst case. We analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm ("the threshold algorithm", or TA) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than FA. We show that TA is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. Unlike FA, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), TA requires only a small, constant-size buffer. TA allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. We distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). We consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Aggregation along coarser granularities, such as networks or ASes, accentuates this nonuniform distribution. In one typical trace, for example, the top 9{\%} of flows between ASes accounts for 86.7{\%} of the packets and 90.7{\%} of the bytes transmitted.

abstract = {The querying and analysis of data streams has been a topic of much recent interest, motivated by applications from the fields of networking, web usage analysis, sensor instrumentation, telecommuni- cations, and others. Many of these applications involve monitoring answers to continuous queries over data streams produced at physically distributed locations, and most previous approaches require streams to be transmitted to a single location for centralized processing. Unfortunately, the continual transmis- sion of a large number of rapid data streams to a central location can be impractical or expensive. We study a useful class of queries that continuously report the k largest values obtained from distributed data streams (“top-k monitoring queries”), which are of particular interest because they can be used to reduce the overhead incurred while running other types of monitoring queries. We show that transmit- ting entire data streams is unnecessary to support these queries and present an alternative approach that reduces communication significantly. In our approach, arithmetic constraints are maintained at remote stream sources to ensure that the most recently provided top-k answer remains valid to within a user- specified error tolerance. Distributed communication is only necessary on occasion, when constraints are violated, and we show empirically through extensive simulation on real-world data that our approach reduces overall communication cost by an order of magnitude compared with alternatives that offer the same error guarantees.},

The well established method of using sketches to approximate flow statistics suffers from space inefficiencies. In addition, flow arrival rates are dynamic, thus keeping track of the most recent heavy hitters poses a challenge. Sliding window approximations address this problem, reducing space at the cost of increasing point query time. This paper presents two novel algorithms for identifying heavy hitters in streams and sliding windows. Both algorithms use statically allocated memory and support constant time point queries. For sliding windows, this is an asymptotic improvement over previous work. We also demonstrate reduced memory requirements of up to 85{\%} in streams and 66{\%} in sliding windows over synthetic and real Internet packet traces.},

abstract = {Fine-grained traffic flow measurement, which provides useful information for network management tasks and security analysis, can be challenging to obtain due to monitoring resource constraints. The alternate approach of inferring flow statistics from partial measurement data has to be robust against dynamic temporal/spatial fluctuations of network traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Traffic (de)Aggregation and Measurement Paradigm (iSTAMP), which partitions TCAM entries of switches/routers into two parts to: 1) optimally aggregate part of incoming flows for aggregate measurements, and 2) de-aggregate and directly measure the most informative flows for per-flow measurements. iSTAMP then processes these aggregate and per-flow measurements to effectively estimate network flows using a variety of optimization techniques. With the advent of Software-Defined-Networking (SDN), such real-time rule (re)configuration can be achieved via OpenFlow or other similar SDN APIs. We first show how to design the optimal aggregation matrix for minimizing the flow-size estimation error. Moreover, we propose a method for designing an efficient-compressive flow aggregation matrix under hard resource constraints of limited TCAM sizes. In addition, we propose an intelligent Multi-Armed Bandit based algorithm to adaptively sample the most {\&}{\#}x201C;rewarding{\&}{\#}x201D; flows, whose accurate measurements have the highest impact on the overall flow measurement and estimation performance. We evaluate the performance of iSTAMP using real traffic traces from a variety of network environments and by considering two applications: traffic matrix estimation and heavy hitter detection. Also, we have implemented a prototype of iSTAMP and demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in Mininet environment.},

abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm where network functions are executed on commodity servers located in small cloud nodes distributed across the network, and where software defined mechanisms are used to control the network flows. This paradigm is a major turning point in the evolution of networking, as it introduces high expectations for enhanced economical network services, as well as major technical challenges. In this paper, we address one of the main technical challenges in this domain: the actual placement of the virtual functions within the physical network. This placement has a critical impact on the performance of the network, as well as on its reliability and operation cost. We perform a thorough study of the NFV location problem, show that it introduces a new type of optimization problems, and provide near optimal approximation algorithms guaranteeing a placement with theoretically proven performance. The performance of the solution is evaluated with respect to two measures: the distance cost between the clients and the virtual functions by which they are served, as well as the setup costs of these functions. We provide bi-criteria solutions reaching constant approximation factors with respect to the overall performance, and adhering to the capacity constraints of the networking infrastructure by a constant factor as well. Finally, using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms perform well in many realistic scenarios.},

abstract = {Traffic matrix measurement provides essential information for network design, operation and management. In today's networks, it is challenging to get accurate and timely traffic matrix due to the hard resource constraints of network devices. Recently, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique enables customizable traffic measurement, which can provide flexible and fine-grain visibility into network traffic. However, the existing software-defined traffic measurement solutions often suffer from feasibility and scalability issues. In this paper, we seek accurate, feasible and scalable traffic matrix estimation approaches. We propose two strategies, called Maximum Load Rule First (MLRF) and Large Flow First (LFF), to design feasible traffic measurement rules that can be installed in TCAM entries of SDN switches. The statistics of the measurement rules are collected by the controller to estimate fine-grained traffic matrix. Both MLRF and LFF satisfy the flow aggregation constraints (determined by associated routing policies) and have low-complexity. Extensive simulation results on real network and traffic traces reveal that MLRF and LFF can achieve high accuracy of traffic matrix estimation and high probability of heavy hitter detection.},

Instead of fetching all the latest data in each timestamp, we propose a novel "-top-k query delivering approximate top-k answers with a probabilistic guarantee on the selectively-fetched dataset which is a combination of certain and uncertain data (modelled by their age). In addition, using a cloud environment as well as our proposed method to process "-top-k queries can alleviate the computing-intensive computations, so it is not only cheaper but even faster than an ordinary top-k calculation method.

The basic idea is to install a filter at each sensor node to suppress unnecessary sensor updates. Filter setting and query reevaiuation upon updates are two fundamental issues to the correctness and efficiency of the FILA approach. We develop a query reevaiuation algorithm that is capable of handling concurrent sensor updates. In particular, we present optimization techniques to reduce the probing cost. We design a skewed filter setting scheme, which aims to balance energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. Moreover, two filter update strategies, namely, eager and lazy, are proposed to favor different application scenarios. We also extend the algorithms to several variants of top-k query, that is, orderinsensitive, approximate, and value monitoring. The performance of the proposed FILA approach is extensively evaluated using real data traces. The results show that FILA substantially outperforms the existing TAG-based approach and range caching approach in terms of both network lifetime and energy consumption under various network configurations. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The recent growing popularity of cloud-based solutions and the variety of new applications present new challenges for cloud management and resource utilization. In this paper we concentrate on the networking aspect and consider the placement problem of virtual machines (VMs) of applications with intense bandwidth requirements. Optimizing the available network bandwidth is far more complex than optimizing resources like memory or CPU, since every network link may be used by many physical hosts and thus by the VMs residing in these hosts. We focus on maximizing the benefit from the overall communication sent by the VMs to a single designated point in the data center (called the root). This is the typical case when considering a storage area network of applications with intense storage requirements. We formulate a bandwidth-constrained VM placement optimization problem that models this setting. This problem is NP hard, and we present a polynomial-time constant approximation algorithm for its most general version, in which hosts are connected to the root by a general network graph. For more practical cases, in which the network topology is a tree and the revenue is a simple function of the allocated bandwidth, we present improved approximation algorithms that are more efficient in terms of running time. We evaluate the expected performance of our proposed algorithms through a simulation study over traces from a real production data center, providing strong indications to the superiority of our proposed solutions.},

This segregation increases agility and flexibility of a networking infrastructure and reduces its operational expenses. OpenFlow controllers expose standard interfaces to facilitate variety of networking applications. In particular, a monitoring application can use these interfaces to push into the OpenFlow switches rules that collect traffic flow statistics at different aggregation levels. The aggregation level determines the monitoring accuracy and the induced network overhead. In this paper, we propose Floware an OpenFlow application that allows discovery and monitoring of active flows at any required aggregation level. Floware balances the monitoring overhead among many switches in order to reduce its negative effect on network performance. In addition, Floware integrates with monitoring systems based on legacy protocols such as NetFlow.

abstract = {Network management requires accurate estimates of met-rics for many applications including traffic engineering (e.g., heavy hitters), anomaly detection (e.g., entropy of source addresses), and security (e.g., DDoS detection). Obtain-ing accurate estimates given router CPU and memory con-straints is a challenging problem. Existing approaches fall in one of two undesirable extremes: (1) low fidelity general-purpose approaches such as sampling, or (2) high fidelity but complex algorithms customized to specific application-level metrics. Ideally, a solution should be both general (i.e., supports many applications) and provide accuracy com-parable to custom algorithms. This paper presents Univ-Mon, a framework for flow monitoring which leverages re-cent theoretical advances and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both generality and high accuracy. UnivMon uses an application-agnostic data plane monitoring primitive; dif-ferent (and possibly unforeseen) estimation algorithms run in the control plane, and use the statistics from the data plane to compute application-level metrics. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of UnivMon using P4 and de-velop simple coordination techniques to provide a " one-big-switch " abstraction for network-wide monitoring. We eval-uate the effectiveness of UnivMon using a range of trace-driven evaluations and show that it offers comparable (and sometimes better) accuracy relative to custom sketching so-lutions across a range of monitoring tasks.},

abstract = {We focus on designing efficient flow monitoring algorithms in SDN/OpenFlow by fully exploiting all three polling mechanisms, poll-single, poll-some and poll-all. Notably, the poll-some mechanism has not been adopted by any existing flow monitoring algorithm due to the inflexible match structure standardized in the early version of the OpenFlow specification. To enable the poll-some mechanism, we need to find out the minimum number of match structures required to exactly match all not-yet-covered flows at a switch. An efficient heuristic called Critical Column First (CCF) is then proposed for solving the Minimum Match Structure (MMS) problem. The idea is to consider the column of the flow matrix that can potentially identify the largest number of not-yet-covered flows first. With CCF, an existing flow monitoring algorithm called LFF [1] is extended to support all three polling mechanisms. We call it LFF+ algorithm. As compared with LFF, simulation results show that LFF+ can cut down the communication cost by about 54{\%}.},

Meanwhile, OpenFlow-enabled switches provide rich statistical information for specific flows, tables, and ports which facilitates various network management tasks. However, current traffic monitoring techniques collecting statistics from existing flow entries do not provide the flexibility of querying path-specific flow statistics at any aggregation levels. In this paper, we proposes PathMon which encodes flow and path information as tags to provide that flexibility and corresponding link-to-link correlations for further anomaly detection or traffic engineering tasks. Our implementation runs on commodity switches which are compliant to OpenFlow 1.3 specification and requires only a few monitoring entries for each switch along monitored paths and un-tag entries for each edge switch.},

One of the main management challenges in IXP networks is the management of the so-called elephant flows. Elephant flows, characterized by high throughput and long duration, represent a small fraction of the total flows of an IXP network but have high impact on the overall traffic. A first step in the management of elephant flows is their identification, which becomes more important in SDN-based IXPs that require controllers to have a consistent view of the underlying network to allow fine-grained adjustment. In this paper, we propose, develop, and evaluate a monitoring system to identify elephant flows in an SDN-based IXP network. We demonstrate that our system can assist IXP operators to properly identify elephant flows in an efficient, scalable, and timely manner.},

abstract = {—We report on design, implementation and evaluation of a resource management system that builds upon OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform for private and public clouds that is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry. Our implementation supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud and cur-rently provides allocation for computational resources in support of interactive as well as computationally intensive applications. The design supports an extensible set of management objectives between which the system can switch at runtime. We demonstrate through examples how management objectives related to load-balancing, energy efficiency and service differentiation can be mapped onto the controllers of the resource allocation subsystem, which attempts to achieve an activated management objective at all times. The design is extensible in the sense that addi-tional objectives can be introduced by providing instantiations for generic functions in the controllers. Our implementation monitors the fulfillment of the relevant management metrics in real time. Testbed evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in a dynamic environment. It further illustrates the trade-off between closely meeting a specific management objective and the associated cost of VM live-migration. Index Terms—Cloud management, performance management, management objective, dynamic resource management, Open-Stack I. INTRODUCTION The paper reports on design, implementation and evalua-tion of a resource management system that builds upon the OpenStack cloud platform. The focus is on managing an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, which makes ICT infrastructure available to customers in a virtualized way, including computation in form of virtual machines (VMs), storage in form of virtual disks, for instance, and networking in form of virtual switches, for example. IaaS cloud services are offered by an increasing number of providers, whereby Amazon and RackSpace are probably the most well-known. IaaS cloud environments have proved suitable for running interactive applications, such as websites and social networks, analytics frameworks like MapReduce or media streaming services, such as audio or video on-demand services. The IaaS service model has two principal stakeholders: the IaaS provider who owns and operates the cloud infrastructure and the customers who run their applications on the cloud. (If an IaaS customer, runs a web site, for instance, it has its own customer base that consumes cloud resources through the site.) Customers typically have service level agreements},

abstract = {Monitoring global states of a distributed cloud application is a critical functionality for cloud datacenter management. State monitoring requires meeting two demanding objectives: high level of correctness, which ensures zero or low error rate, and high communication efficiency, which demands minimal communication cost in detecting state updates. Most existing work follows an instantaneous model which triggers state alerts whenever a constraint is violated. This model may cause frequent and unnecessary alerts due to momentary value bursts and outliers. Countermeasures of such alerts may further cause problematic operations. In this paper, we present a WIndow-based StatE monitoring (WISE) framework for efficiently managing cloud applications. Window-based state monitoring reports alerts only when state violation is continuous within a time window. We show that it is not only more resilient to value bursts and outliers, but also able to save considerable communication when implemented in a distributed manner based on four technical contributions. First, we present the architectural design and deployment options for window-based state monitoring with centralized parameter tuning. Second, we develop a new distributed parameter tuning scheme enabling WISE to scale to much more monitoring nodes as each node tunes its monitoring parameters reactively without global information. Third, we introduce two optimization techniques, including their design rationale, correctness and usage model, to further reduce the communication cost. Finally, we provide an in-depth empirical study of the scalability of WISE, and evaluate the improvement brought by the distributed tuning scheme and the two performance optimizations. Our results show that WISE reduces communication by 50-90 percent compared with instantaneous monitoring approaches, and the improved WISE gains a clear scalability advantage over its centralized version.},

abstract = {In many cases, data networks need to be monitored to ensure that they stay within acceptable parameters. The monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. In many cases it is too complex, or too expensive, to conduct explicit monitoring at all times. In these cases, information (integrity constraints) on the evolution of the network status can often allow us to use past measurements to infer the future behavior, thus reducing the monitoring cost. We provide a formal description of the problem of monitoring rapidly changing data, which we call the monitoring problem. We then classify this problem in terms of the integrity constraints that govern the evolution of the environment, and propose different algorithms for each of these classes. For the most restricted case, we can find a greedy algorithm which is optimal, while for the more general cases, we use competitive analysis and show that optimal worst and average case cost measuring algorithms exist. We then present heuristics for low-cost low-complexity measuring algorithms. We believe that the results of this paper can serve as a framework for further studies.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maintaining aggregates and statistics over data streams, with respect to the last N data elements seen so far. We refer to this model as the sliding window model. We consider the following basic problem: Given a stream of bits, maintain a count of the number of 1's in the last N elements seen from the stream. We show that, using O(1 log 2 N) bits of memory, we can estimate the number of 1's to within a factor of 1 + . We also give a matching lower bound of Ω(1 log 2 N) memory bits for any deterministic or randomized algorithms. We extend our scheme to maintain the sum of the last N positive integers and provide matching upper and lower bounds for this more general problem as well. We also show how to efficiently compute the Lp norms (p ∈ [1, 2]) of vectors in the sliding window model using our techniques. Using our algorithm, one can adapt many other techniques to work for the sliding window model with a multiplicative overhead of O(1 log N) in memory and a 1 + factor loss in accuracy. These include maintaining approximate histograms, hash tables, and statistics or aggregates such as sum and averages. 1. Introduction. Traditional database management systems (DBMSs) expect all data to be managed within some form of persistent data sets. For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite, is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is appropriate when significant portions of the data are queried again and again, and updates are small and/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream is appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to operate on large portions of the data multiple times. One of the challenging aspects of processing over data streams is that, while the length of a data stream may be unbounded, making it impractical or undesirable to store the entire contents of the stream, for many applications, it is still important to retain some ability to execute queries that reference past data. For example, in order to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, it is useful to be able to detect when the pattern of recent transactions for a particular account differs significantly from the earlier transactional history of that account. In order to support queries of this sort using a bounded amount of storage (either in memory or in a traditional DBMS), it is necessary to devise techniques for storing summary or synoptic information about previously seen portions of data streams. Generally there is a tradeoff between the},

Our goal is to encourage network- ing vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets.

In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too.},

abstract = {In software-defined networks (SDNs), the network controller first formulates abstract network-wide policies, and then implements them in the forwarding tables of network switches. However, fast SDN tables often cannot scale beyond a few hundred entries. This is because they typically include wildcards, and therefore are implemented using either expensive and power-hungry TCAMs, or complex and slow data structures. This paper presents the Palette distribution framework for decomposing large SDN tables into small ones and then distributing them across the network, while preserving the overall SDN policy semantics. Palette helps balance the sizes of the tables across the network, as well as reduce the total number of entries by sharing resources among different connections. It copes with two NP-hard optimization problems: Decomposing a large SDN table into equivalent subtables, and distributing the subtables such that each connection traverses each type of subtable at least once. To implement the Palette distribution framework, we introduce graph-theoretical formulations and algorithms, and show that they achieve close-to-optimal results in practice.},

With high bandwidth links and consequently increasing traffic volumes, it is difficult to collect and analyze detailed flow records in an online manner. Traditional solutions that decouple data collection from analysis resort to sampling and sketching to handle large monitoring traffic volumes. We propose a new system, Pegasus, to leverage commercially available co-located compute and storage devices near routers and switches. Pegasus adaptively manages data transfers between monitors and aggregators based on traffic patterns and user queries. We use Pegasus to detect global icebergs or global heavy-hitters. Icebergs are flows with a common property that contribute a significant fraction of network traffic. For example, DDoS attack detection is an iceberg detection problem with a common destination IP. Other applications include identification of “top talkers,” top destinations, and detection of worms and port scans. Experiments with Abilene traces, sFlow traces from an enterprise network, and deployment of Pegasus as a live monitoring service on PlanetLab show that our system is accurate and scales well with increasing traffic and number of monitors.},

Besides typical accounting mechanisms and the emerging area of charging in next generation networks, especially network security solutions rely on efficient and optimized monitoring. Network monitoring in high-speed networks is usually based on flow accounting and aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-growing network capacities. In this paper, we propose a flexible flow aggregation mechanism that can be directly employed on a monitoring probe to reduce the memory and processing demands. Alternatively, it can work as a concentrator that collects flow data from multiple monitoring probes, combines and aggregates them and forwards the results to an analyzer. We verified and evaluated the aggregation mechanism by integrating it into our monitoring probe Vermont. Our approach opens new prospects for high-speed network monitoring and allows coping with special situations that cannot be treated satisfyingly by traditional flow accounting, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks causing very high numbers of flows. Aggregated flow data are an easy-to-handle form of packet information especially for anomaly detection and accounting issues},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decentralized self-adaptive management framework that infers the current context of the hosting environment and dynamically decides what management strategy should be used in order to minimize the cost and maximize the performance of management. We investigate the use of this framework in the case of the aggregated information monitoring, where only one scheme (i.e. situated or global) is generally used for collecting aggregated information whatever the nature of the management information and its environment are. We propose a self-adaptive aggregation mechanism based on fuzzy logic, that estimates the cost and the performance of given aggregation schemes. {\textcopyright} 2011 IFIP.},

abstract = {The Internet service model emphasizes flexibility -- any node can send any type of traffic at any time. While this design has allowed new applications and usage models to flourish, it also makes the job of network management significantly more challenging. This paper describes a new method of traffic characterization that automatically groups traffic into minimal clusters of conspicuous consumption. Rather than providing a static analysis specialized to capture flows, applications, or network-to-network traffic matrices, our approach dynamically produces hybrid traffic definitions that match the underlying usage. For example, rather than report five hundred small flows, or the amount of TCP traffic to port 80, or the "top ten hosts", our method might reveal that a certain percent of traffic was used by TCP connections between AOL clients and a particular group of Web servers. Similarly, our technique can be used to automatically classify new traffic patterns, such as network worms or peer-to-peer applications, without knowing the structure of such traffic a priori. We describe a series of algorithms for constructing these traffic clusters and minimizing their representation. In addition, we describe the design of our prototype system, AutoFocus and our experiences using it to discover the dominant and unusual modes of usage on several different production networks.},

abstract = {Networks are monitored in order to ensure that the system operates within desirable parameters. The increasing complexity of networks and services provided by them increases this need for monitoring. Monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. Conducting such monitoring introduces traffic overhead that may reduce the overall effective throughput. This paper studies ways to minimize the monitoring communication overhead in IP networks. We develop and analyze several monitoring algorithms that achieve significant reduction in the management overhead while maintaining the functionality. The main idea is to combine global polling with local event driven reporting. The amount of traffic saving depends on the statistical characterization of the monitored data. We indicate the specific statistical factors that affect the saving and show how to choose the right algorithm for the type, of monitored data. In particular, our results show that for Internet traffic our algorithms can save more than 90{\%} of the monitoring traffic.},

The expand and collapse (EaC) algorithm is a heuristic that periodically adjusts the subset of nodes of the search tree at which statistics are gathered, in order to use the limited space available to collect statistics in preference from the currently most heavily-hit nodes in the search tree. We prove convergence and good node-hit coverage of the algorithm and validate its performance on a set of simulated data.

@article{Fagin2003a,
abstract = {Assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for each of m attributes. For example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. For each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its. grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). Each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, such as min or average. To determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. Fagin has given an algorithm ("Fagin's Algorithm", or FA) that is much more efficient. For some monotone aggregation functions, FA is optimal with high probability in the worst case. We analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm ("the threshold algorithm", or TA) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than FA. We show that TA is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. Unlike FA, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), TA requires only a small, constant-size buffer. TA allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. We distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). We consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The high speeds and complexity of today's network make the traditional slow open-loop measurement schemes infeasible.

To the heart of our solution are three streaming algorithms that provide a tight integration between the measurement platform and the measurements. The algorithms cater to varying degrees of computational budgets, detection latency, and accuracy. We empirically evaluate our streaming solutions on a highly parallel and programmable measurement platform. The algorithms demonstrate a marked 100{\&}{\#}x025; accuracy increase from a recently proposed MRT algorithm in detecting DoS attacks made up of synthetic hard-to-track elephant flows. Our proposed algorithms maintain the worst case complexities of the MRT, while empirically demonstrating a moderate increase in average resource utilization.},

abstract = {Today's data centers offer tremendous aggregate bandwidth to clusters of tens of thousands of machines. However, because of limited port densities in even the highest-end switches, data center topologies typically consist of multi-rooted trees with many equal-cost paths between any given pair of hosts. Existing IP multipathing protocols usually rely on per-flow static hashing and can cause substantial bandwidth losses due to longterm collisions. In this paper, we present Hedera, a scalable, dynamic flow scheduling system that adaptively schedules a multi-stage switching fabric to efficiently utilize aggregate network resources. We describe our implementation using commodity switches and unmodified hosts, and show that for a simulated 8,192 host data center, Hedera delivers bisection bandwidth that is 96{\%} of optimal and up to 113{\%} better than static load-balancing methods.},

The traces display a highly nonuniform distribution of traffic on flows between pairs of hosts, networks, and ASes. Aggregation along coarser granularities, such as networks or ASes, accentuates this nonuniform distribution. In one typical trace, for example, the top 9{\%} of flows between ASes accounts for 86.7{\%} of the packets and 90.7{\%} of the bytes transmitted. A highly nonuniform traffic pattern suggests that routers need to maintain only limited QoS flow state. The paper discusses the implications of this phenomenon on different proposed QoS mechanisms},

abstract = {The querying and analysis of data streams has been a topic of much recent interest, motivated by applications from the fields of networking, web usage analysis, sensor instrumentation, telecommuni- cations, and others. Many of these applications involve monitoring answers to continuous queries over data streams produced at physically distributed locations, and most previous approaches require streams to be transmitted to a single location for centralized processing. Unfortunately, the continual transmis- sion of a large number of rapid data streams to a central location can be impractical or expensive. We study a useful class of queries that continuously report the k largest values obtained from distributed data streams (“top-k monitoring queries”), which are of particular interest because they can be used to reduce the overhead incurred while running other types of monitoring queries. We show that transmit- ting entire data streams is unnecessary to support these queries and present an alternative approach that reduces communication significantly. In our approach, arithmetic constraints are maintained at remote stream sources to ensure that the most recently provided top-k answer remains valid to within a user- specified error tolerance. Distributed communication is only necessary on occasion, when constraints are violated, and we show empirically through extensive simulation on real-world data that our approach reduces overall communication cost by an order of magnitude compared with alternatives that offer the same error guarantees.},

abstract = {Fine-grained traffic flow measurement, which provides useful information for network management tasks and security analysis, can be challenging to obtain due to monitoring resource constraints. The alternate approach of inferring flow statistics from partial measurement data has to be robust against dynamic temporal/spatial fluctuations of network traffic. In this paper, we propose an intelligent Traffic (de)Aggregation and Measurement Paradigm (iSTAMP), which partitions TCAM entries of switches/routers into two parts to: 1) optimally aggregate part of incoming flows for aggregate measurements, and 2) de-aggregate and directly measure the most informative flows for per-flow measurements. iSTAMP then processes these aggregate and per-flow measurements to effectively estimate network flows using a variety of optimization techniques. With the advent of Software-Defined-Networking (SDN), such real-time rule (re)configuration can be achieved via OpenFlow or other similar SDN APIs. We first show how to design the optimal aggregation matrix for minimizing the flow-size estimation error. Moreover, we propose a method for designing an efficient-compressive flow aggregation matrix under hard resource constraints of limited TCAM sizes. In addition, we propose an intelligent Multi-Armed Bandit based algorithm to adaptively sample the most {\&}{\#}x201C;rewarding{\&}{\#}x201D; flows, whose accurate measurements have the highest impact on the overall flow measurement and estimation performance. We evaluate the performance of iSTAMP using real traffic traces from a variety of network environments and by considering two applications: traffic matrix estimation and heavy hitter detection. Also, we have implemented a prototype of iSTAMP and demonstrated its feasibility and effectiveness in Mininet environment.},

We present a new streaming approximation algorithm for computing Hierarchical Heavy Hitters that has several advantages over previous algorithms.

abstract = {Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a new networking paradigm where network functions are executed on commodity servers located in small cloud nodes distributed across the network, and where software defined mechanisms are used to control the network flows. This paradigm is a major turning point in the evolution of networking, as it introduces high expectations for enhanced economical network services, as well as major technical challenges. In this paper, we address one of the main technical challenges in this domain: the actual placement of the virtual functions within the physical network. This placement has a critical impact on the performance of the network, as well as on its reliability and operation cost. We perform a thorough study of the NFV location problem, show that it introduces a new type of optimization problems, and provide near optimal approximation algorithms guaranteeing a placement with theoretically proven performance. The performance of the solution is evaluated with respect to two measures: the distance cost between the clients and the virtual functions by which they are served, as well as the setup costs of these functions. We provide bi-criteria solutions reaching constant approximation factors with respect to the overall performance, and adhering to the capacity constraints of the networking infrastructure by a constant factor as well. Finally, using extensive simulations, we show that the proposed algorithms perform well in many realistic scenarios.},

abstract = {Traffic matrix measurement provides essential information for network design, operation and management. In today's networks, it is challenging to get accurate and timely traffic matrix due to the hard resource constraints of network devices. Recently, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technique enables customizable traffic measurement, which can provide flexible and fine-grain visibility into network traffic. However, the existing software-defined traffic measurement solutions often suffer from feasibility and scalability issues. In this paper, we seek accurate, feasible and scalable traffic matrix estimation approaches. We propose two strategies, called Maximum Load Rule First (MLRF) and Large Flow First (LFF), to design feasible traffic measurement rules that can be installed in TCAM entries of SDN switches. The statistics of the measurement rules are collected by the controller to estimate fine-grained traffic matrix. Both MLRF and LFF satisfy the flow aggregation constraints (determined by associated routing policies) and have low-complexity. Extensive simulation results on real network and traffic traces reveal that MLRF and LFF can achieve high accuracy of traffic matrix estimation and high probability of heavy hitter detection.},

This paper originally presents an expense-minimizing framework for top-k monitoring in sensor cloud services where the expense is denoted by the costs of data requests. Instead of fetching all the latest data in each timestamp, we propose a novel "-top-k query delivering approximate top-k answers with a probabilistic guarantee on the selectively-fetched dataset which is a combination of certain and uncertain data (modelled by their age). In addition, using a cloud environment as well as our proposed method to process "-top-k queries can alleviate the computing-intensive computations, so it is not only cheaper but even faster than an ordinary top-k calculation method. The extensive experiments on the real-world climate datasets demonstrate that our methods can reduce the expense by more than half with desirable accuracy. {\&}copy; 2016 ACM.},

abstract = {Top-k monitoring is important to many wireless sensor applications. This paper exploits the semantics of top-k query and proposes an energy-efficient monitoring approach called FILA. The basic idea is to install a filter at each sensor node to suppress unnecessary sensor updates. Filter setting and query reevaiuation upon updates are two fundamental issues to the correctness and efficiency of the FILA approach. We develop a query reevaiuation algorithm that is capable of handling concurrent sensor updates. In particular, we present optimization techniques to reduce the probing cost. We design a skewed filter setting scheme, which aims to balance energy consumption and prolong network lifetime. Moreover, two filter update strategies, namely, eager and lazy, are proposed to favor different application scenarios. We also extend the algorithms to several variants of top-k query, that is, orderinsensitive, approximate, and value monitoring. The performance of the proposed FILA approach is extensively evaluated using real data traces. The results show that FILA substantially outperforms the existing TAG-based approach and range caching approach in terms of both network lifetime and energy consumption under various network configurations. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {The recent growing popularity of cloud-based solutions and the variety of new applications present new challenges for cloud management and resource utilization. In this paper we concentrate on the networking aspect and consider the placement problem of virtual machines (VMs) of applications with intense bandwidth requirements. Optimizing the available network bandwidth is far more complex than optimizing resources like memory or CPU, since every network link may be used by many physical hosts and thus by the VMs residing in these hosts. We focus on maximizing the benefit from the overall communication sent by the VMs to a single designated point in the data center (called the root). This is the typical case when considering a storage area network of applications with intense storage requirements. We formulate a bandwidth-constrained VM placement optimization problem that models this setting. This problem is NP hard, and we present a polynomial-time constant approximation algorithm for its most general version, in which hosts are connected to the root by a general network graph. For more practical cases, in which the network topology is a tree and the revenue is a simple function of the allocated bandwidth, we present improved approximation algorithms that are more efficient in terms of running time. We evaluate the expected performance of our proposed algorithms through a simulation study over traces from a real production data center, providing strong indications to the superiority of our proposed solutions.},

OpenFlow controllers expose standard interfaces to facilitate variety of networking applications.

The aggregation level determines the monitoring accuracy and the induced network overhead. In this paper, we propose Floware an OpenFlow application that allows discovery and monitoring of active flows at any required aggregation level. Floware balances the monitoring overhead among many switches in order to reduce its negative effect on network performance. In addition, Floware integrates with monitoring systems based on legacy protocols such as NetFlow.

Obtain-ing accurate estimates given router CPU and memory con-straints is a challenging problem. Existing approaches fall in one of two undesirable extremes: (1) low fidelity general-purpose approaches such as sampling, or (2) high fidelity but complex algorithms customized to specific application-level metrics. Ideally, a solution should be both general (i.e., supports many applications) and provide accuracy com-parable to custom algorithms. This paper presents Univ-Mon, a framework for flow monitoring which leverages re-cent theoretical advances and demonstrates that it is possible to achieve both generality and high accuracy. UnivMon uses an application-agnostic data plane monitoring primitive; dif-ferent (and possibly unforeseen) estimation algorithms run in the control plane, and use the statistics from the data plane to compute application-level metrics. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of UnivMon using P4 and de-velop simple coordination techniques to provide a " one-big-switch " abstraction for network-wide monitoring. We eval-uate the effectiveness of UnivMon using a range of trace-driven evaluations and show that it offers comparable (and sometimes better) accuracy relative to custom sketching so-lutions across a range of monitoring tasks.},

abstract = {We focus on designing efficient flow monitoring algorithms in SDN/OpenFlow by fully exploiting all three polling mechanisms, poll-single, poll-some and poll-all. Notably, the poll-some mechanism has not been adopted by any existing flow monitoring algorithm due to the inflexible match structure standardized in the early version of the OpenFlow specification. To enable the poll-some mechanism, we need to find out the minimum number of match structures required to exactly match all not-yet-covered flows at a switch. An efficient heuristic called Critical Column First (CCF) is then proposed for solving the Minimum Match Structure (MMS) problem. The idea is to consider the column of the flow matrix that can potentially identify the largest number of not-yet-covered flows first. With CCF, an existing flow monitoring algorithm called LFF [1] is extended to support all three polling mechanisms. We call it LFF+ algorithm. As compared with LFF, simulation results show that LFF+ can cut down the communication cost by about 54{\%}.},

However, current traffic monitoring techniques collecting statistics from existing flow entries do not provide the flexibility of querying path-specific flow statistics at any aggregation levels. In this paper, we proposes PathMon which encodes flow and path information as tags to provide that flexibility and corresponding link-to-link correlations for further anomaly detection or traffic engineering tasks. Our implementation runs on commodity switches which are compliant to OpenFlow 1.3 specification and requires only a few monitoring entries for each switch along monitored paths and un-tag entries for each edge switch.},

abstract = {Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are fundamental blocks of the Internet ecosystem by providing cost-effective connections among multiple autonomous systems (ASes). One of the main management challenges in IXP networks is the management of the so-called elephant flows. Elephant flows, characterized by high throughput and long duration, represent a small fraction of the total flows of an IXP network but have high impact on the overall traffic. A first step in the management of elephant flows is their identification, which becomes more important in SDN-based IXPs that require controllers to have a consistent view of the underlying network to allow fine-grained adjustment. In this paper, we propose, develop, and evaluate a monitoring system to identify elephant flows in an SDN-based IXP network. We demonstrate that our system can assist IXP operators to properly identify elephant flows in an efficient, scalable, and timely manner.},

abstract = {—We report on design, implementation and evaluation of a resource management system that builds upon OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform for private and public clouds that is rapidly gaining acceptance in industry. Our implementation supports an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud and cur-rently provides allocation for computational resources in support of interactive as well as computationally intensive applications. The design supports an extensible set of management objectives between which the system can switch at runtime. We demonstrate through examples how management objectives related to load-balancing, energy efficiency and service differentiation can be mapped onto the controllers of the resource allocation subsystem, which attempts to achieve an activated management objective at all times. The design is extensible in the sense that addi-tional objectives can be introduced by providing instantiations for generic functions in the controllers. Our implementation monitors the fulfillment of the relevant management metrics in real time. Testbed evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in a dynamic environment. It further illustrates the trade-off between closely meeting a specific management objective and the associated cost of VM live-migration. Index Terms—Cloud management, performance management, management objective, dynamic resource management, Open-Stack I. INTRODUCTION The paper reports on design, implementation and evalua-tion of a resource management system that builds upon the OpenStack cloud platform. The focus is on managing an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, which makes ICT infrastructure available to customers in a virtualized way, including computation in form of virtual machines (VMs), storage in form of virtual disks, for instance, and networking in form of virtual switches, for example. IaaS cloud services are offered by an increasing number of providers, whereby Amazon and RackSpace are probably the most well-known. IaaS cloud environments have proved suitable for running interactive applications, such as websites and social networks, analytics frameworks like MapReduce or media streaming services, such as audio or video on-demand services. The IaaS service model has two principal stakeholders: the IaaS provider who owns and operates the cloud infrastructure and the customers who run their applications on the cloud. (If an IaaS customer, runs a web site, for instance, it has its own customer base that consumes cloud resources through the site.) Customers typically have service level agreements},

abstract = {Monitoring global states of a distributed cloud application is a critical functionality for cloud datacenter management. State monitoring requires meeting two demanding objectives: high level of correctness, which ensures zero or low error rate, and high communication efficiency, which demands minimal communication cost in detecting state updates. Most existing work follows an instantaneous model which triggers state alerts whenever a constraint is violated. This model may cause frequent and unnecessary alerts due to momentary value bursts and outliers. Countermeasures of such alerts may further cause problematic operations. In this paper, we present a WIndow-based StatE monitoring (WISE) framework for efficiently managing cloud applications. Window-based state monitoring reports alerts only when state violation is continuous within a time window. We show that it is not only more resilient to value bursts and outliers, but also able to save considerable communication when implemented in a distributed manner based on four technical contributions. First, we present the architectural design and deployment options for window-based state monitoring with centralized parameter tuning. Second, we develop a new distributed parameter tuning scheme enabling WISE to scale to much more monitoring nodes as each node tunes its monitoring parameters reactively without global information. Third, we introduce two optimization techniques, including their design rationale, correctness and usage model, to further reduce the communication cost. Finally, we provide an in-depth empirical study of the scalability of WISE, and evaluate the improvement brought by the distributed tuning scheme and the two performance optimizations. Our results show that WISE reduces communication by 50-90 percent compared with instantaneous monitoring approaches, and the improved WISE gains a clear scalability advantage over its centralized version.},

abstract = {In many cases, data networks need to be monitored to ensure that they stay within acceptable parameters. The monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. In many cases it is too complex, or too expensive, to conduct explicit monitoring at all times. In these cases, information (integrity constraints) on the evolution of the network status can often allow us to use past measurements to infer the future behavior, thus reducing the monitoring cost. We provide a formal description of the problem of monitoring rapidly changing data, which we call the monitoring problem. We then classify this problem in terms of the integrity constraints that govern the evolution of the environment, and propose different algorithms for each of these classes. For the most restricted case, we can find a greedy algorithm which is optimal, while for the more general cases, we use competitive analysis and show that optimal worst and average case cost measuring algorithms exist. We then present heuristics for low-cost low-complexity measuring algorithms. We believe that the results of this paper can serve as a framework for further studies.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of maintaining aggregates and statistics over data streams, with respect to the last N data elements seen so far. We refer to this model as the sliding window model. We consider the following basic problem: Given a stream of bits, maintain a count of the number of 1's in the last N elements seen from the stream. We show that, using O(1 log 2 N) bits of memory, we can estimate the number of 1's to within a factor of 1 + . We also give a matching lower bound of Ω(1 log 2 N) memory bits for any deterministic or randomized algorithms. We extend our scheme to maintain the sum of the last N positive integers and provide matching upper and lower bounds for this more general problem as well. We also show how to efficiently compute the Lp norms (p ∈ [1, 2]) of vectors in the sliding window model using our techniques. Using our algorithm, one can adapt many other techniques to work for the sliding window model with a multiplicative overhead of O(1 log N) in memory and a 1 + factor loss in accuracy. These include maintaining approximate histograms, hash tables, and statistics or aggregates such as sum and averages. 1. Introduction. Traditional database management systems (DBMSs) expect all data to be managed within some form of persistent data sets. For many recent applications, the concept of a data stream, possibly infinite, is more appropriate than a data set. By nature, a stored data set is appropriate when significant portions of the data are queried again and again, and updates are small and/or relatively infrequent. In contrast, a data stream is appropriate when the data is changing constantly (often exclusively through insertions of new elements), and it is either unnecessary or impractical to operate on large portions of the data multiple times. One of the challenging aspects of processing over data streams is that, while the length of a data stream may be unbounded, making it impractical or undesirable to store the entire contents of the stream, for many applications, it is still important to retain some ability to execute queries that reference past data. For example, in order to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, it is useful to be able to detect when the pattern of recent transactions for a particular account differs significantly from the earlier transactional history of that account. In order to support queries of this sort using a bounded amount of storage (either in memory or in a traditional DBMS), it is necessary to devise techniques for storing summary or synoptic information about previously seen portions of data streams. Generally there is a tradeoff between the},

Our goal is to encourage network- ing vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on hetero- geneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too.},

abstract = {In software-defined networks (SDNs), the network controller first formulates abstract network-wide policies, and then implements them in the forwarding tables of network switches. However, fast SDN tables often cannot scale beyond a few hundred entries. This is because they typically include wildcards, and therefore are implemented using either expensive and power-hungry TCAMs, or complex and slow data structures. This paper presents the Palette distribution framework for decomposing large SDN tables into small ones and then distributing them across the network, while preserving the overall SDN policy semantics. Palette helps balance the sizes of the tables across the network, as well as reduce the total number of entries by sharing resources among different connections. It copes with two NP-hard optimization problems: Decomposing a large SDN table into equivalent subtables, and distributing the subtables such that each connection traverses each type of subtable at least once. To implement the Palette distribution framework, we introduce graph-theoretical formulations and algorithms, and show that they achieve close-to-optimal results in practice.},

With high bandwidth links and consequently increasing traffic volumes, it is difficult to collect and analyze detailed flow records in an online manner. Traditional solutions that decouple data collection from analysis resort to sampling and sketching to handle large monitoring traffic volumes. We propose a new system, Pegasus, to leverage commercially available co-located compute and storage devices near routers and switches. Pegasus adaptively manages data transfers between monitors and aggregators based on traffic patterns and user queries. We use Pegasus to detect global icebergs or global heavy-hitters. Icebergs are flows with a common property that contribute a significant fraction of network traffic. For example, DDoS attack detection is an iceberg detection problem with a common destination IP. Other applications include identification of “top talkers,” top destinations, and detection of worms and port scans. Experiments with Abilene traces, sFlow traces from an enterprise network, and deployment of Pegasus as a live monitoring service on PlanetLab show that our system is accurate and scales well with increasing traffic and number of monitors.},

Besides typical accounting mechanisms and the emerging area of charging in next generation networks, especially network security solutions rely on efficient and optimized monitoring. Network monitoring in high-speed networks is usually based on flow accounting and aggregation techniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope with increasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-growing network capacities. In this paper, we propose a flexible flow aggregation mechanism that can be directly employed on a monitoring probe to reduce the memory and processing demands. Alternatively, it can work as a concentrator that collects flow data from multiple monitoring probes, combines and aggregates them and forwards the results to an analyzer. We verified and evaluated the aggregation mechanism by integrating it into our monitoring probe Vermont. Our approach opens new prospects for high-speed network monitoring and allows coping with special situations that cannot be treated satisfyingly by traditional flow accounting, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks causing very high numbers of flows.

While this design has allowed new applications and usage models to flourish, it also makes the job of network management significantly more challenging. This paper describes a new method of traffic characterization that automatically groups traffic into minimal clusters of conspicuous consumption. Rather than providing a static analysis specialized to capture flows, applications, or network-to-network traffic matrices, our approach dynamically produces hybrid traffic definitions that match the underlying usage. For example, rather than report five hundred small flows, or the amount of TCP traffic to port 80, or the "top ten hosts", our method might reveal that a certain percent of traffic was used by TCP connections between AOL clients and a particular group of Web servers. Similarly, our technique can be used to automatically classify new traffic patterns, such as network worms or peer-to-peer applications, without knowing the structure of such traffic a priori. We describe a series of algorithms for constructing these traffic clusters and minimizing their representation. In addition, we describe the design of our prototype system, AutoFocus and our experiences using it to discover the dominant and unusual modes of usage on several different production networks.},

abstract = {Networks are monitored in order to ensure that the system operates within desirable parameters. The increasing complexity of networks and services provided by them increases this need for monitoring. Monitoring consists of measuring properties of the network, and of inferring an aggregate predicate from these measurements. Conducting such monitoring introduces traffic overhead that may reduce the overall effective throughput. This paper studies ways to minimize the monitoring communication overhead in IP networks. We develop and analyze several monitoring algorithms that achieve significant reduction in the management overhead while maintaining the functionality. The main idea is to combine global polling with local event driven reporting. The amount of traffic saving depends on the statistical characterization of the monitored data. We indicate the specific statistical factors that affect the saving and show how to choose the right algorithm for the type, of monitored data. In particular, our results show that for Internet traffic our algorithms can save more than 90{\%} of the monitoring traffic.},

abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for efficiently gathering statistics about the hit frequencies on the nodes of a search tree in a packet processing system, under limiting space constraints. The expand and collapse (EaC) algorithm is a heuristic that periodically adjusts the subset of nodes of the search tree at which statistics are gathered, in order to use the limited space available to collect statistics in preference from the currently most heavily-hit nodes in the search tree. We prove convergence and good node-hit coverage of the algorithm and validate its performance on a set of simulated data. The information collected can be useful for a variety of reasons, such as inferring traffic properties, discovering failures and attacks or dynamically optimizing the search method itself for locality patterns in the oncoming traffic.},

@article{Fagin2003a,
abstract = {Assume that each object in a database has m grades, or scores, one for each of m attributes. For example, an object can have a color grade, that tells how red it is, and a shape grade, that tells how round it is. For each attribute, there is a sorted list, which lists each object and its. grade under that attribute, sorted by grade (highest grade first). Each object is assigned an overall grade, that is obtained by combining the attribute grades using a fixed monotone aggregation function, or combining rule, such as min or average. To determine the top k objects, that is, k objects with the highest overall grades, the naive algorithm must access every object in the database, to find its grade under each attribute. Fagin has given an algorithm ("Fagin's Algorithm", or FA) that is much more efficient. For some monotone aggregation functions, FA is optimal with high probability in the worst case. We analyze an elegant and remarkably simple algorithm ("the threshold algorithm", or TA) that is optimal in a much stronger sense than FA. We show that TA is essentially optimal, not just for some monotone aggregation functions, but for all of them, and not just in a high-probability worst-case sense, but over every database. Unlike FA, which requires large buffers (whose size may grow unboundedly as the database size grows), TA requires only a small, constant-size buffer. TA allows early stopping, which yields, in a precise sense, an approximate version of the top k answers. We distinguish two types of access: sorted access (where the middleware system obtains the grade of an object in some sorted list by proceeding through the list sequentially from the top), and random access (where the middleware system requests the grade of object in a list, and obtains it in one step). We consider the scenarios where random access is either impossible, or expensive relative to sorted access, and provide algorithms that are essentially optimal for these cases as well. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Streaming network traffic measurements and analysis is critical for detecting and preventing any real-time anomalies in the network. The high speeds and complexity of today's network make the traditional slow open-loop measurement schemes infeasible. We propose an alternate closed-loop measurement paradigm and demonstrate its practical realization. To the heart of our solution are three streaming algorithms that provide a tight integration between the measurement platform and the measurements. The algorithms cater to varying degrees of computational budgets, detection latency, and accuracy. We empirically evaluate our streaming solutions on a highly parallel and programmable measurement platform. The algorithms demonstrate a marked 100{\&}{\#}x025; accuracy increase from a recently proposed MRT algorithm in detecting DoS attacks made up of synthetic hard-to-track elephant flows. Our proposed algorithms maintain the worst case complexities of the MRT, while empirically demonstrating a moderate increase in average resource utilization.},

abstract = {Competitive auctions encourage consumers to bid their utility values while achieving revenue close to that of fixed pricing with perfect market analysis. These auctions were introduced in [6] in the context of selling an unlimited number of copies of a single item (e.g., rights to watch a movie broadcast). In this paper we study the case of multiple items (e.g., concurrent broadcast of several movies). We show auctions that are competitive for this case. The underlying auction mechanisms are more sophisticated than in the single item case, and require solving an interesting optimization problem. Our results are based on a sampling problem that may have other applications.},
